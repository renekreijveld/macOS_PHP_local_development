Yes, you can also install complete applications with Homebrew :-)

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a versatile code editor with lots of extensions available.

```

After installation consider adding the VSCode icon to your dock.

- Start VSCode and configure to your desire. When done, click on Command-Shift-P.
- Type 'path' (without the quotes).
- Choose Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH.
- Click OK.
- Type your password and click OK.

VSCode is now configured so you can start it from the commandline in the terminal.
